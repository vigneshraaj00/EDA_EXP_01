**#Experiment 1: EDA in IPL Dataset**
**Aim:**
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IPL matches dataset and derive insights about matches per season, winning teams, toss decisions, and top venues.

**Algorithm / Procedure:**

**1.Import Libraries**
  Import pandas for data handling.
  Import matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
**2.Load Dataset**
  Use pd.read_csv() to load the IPL matches dataset.
  Check dataset shape using .shape.
  View first 5 rows using .head().
**3.Matches per Season (Univariate Analysis)**
  Group data by season and count matches.
  Plot a bar chart to visualize growth/decline in matches.
**4.Top Winning Teams (Univariate Analysis)**
  Use value_counts() on the winner column.
  Plot top 5 winning teams in a bar chart.
**5.Toss Decisions (Univariate Analysis)**
  Count toss decision preferences (bat vs field).
  Plot results using a bar chart.
**6.Top Venues (Univariate Analysis)**
  Count matches per venue.
  Display top 5 venues with a horizontal bar chart.
**7.Draw Insights**
  Observe patterns in toss decisions.
  Identify teams with consistent winning trends.
